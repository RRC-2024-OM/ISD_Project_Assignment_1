### Assignment

#### *Assignment 1 :  Automated Teller Project*

In this assignment i developed of two core classes: BankAccount and Client. The BankAccount class manages bank account details and transactions, while the Client class handles client information. The goal is to implement encapsulation to protect internal data and provide controlled access through methods and properties.

##### Encapsulation

##### Bank Account Class

In the BankAccount class, private attributes such as __account_number,__client_number, and __balance are hidden from direct access to prevent unauthorized changes. Public properties and methods, like deposit, withdraw, and update_balance, allow controlled interactions, ensuring that the balance is modified only under valid conditions.

##### Assignment 2: Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism
